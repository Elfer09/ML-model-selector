## ⚙️ Local Setup

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elfer09/ML-model-selector.git
cd ML-model-selector
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Add your OpenAI API key**

Option A — via `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your key
```

Option B — directly in the app sidebar (no setup needed, key is not stored).

**4. Run the app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## 💡 How It Works

### Chat with Your Data
The dataset is profiled on upload (shape, dtypes, describe stats, sample rows). This profile is injected into the LLM's system prompt as structured context. Every user question is answered grounded in that context, no hallucination risk on column names or statistics.

### ML Training
Models are wrapped in a `Pipeline` with `SimpleImputer` → `StandardScaler` → model. All models are evaluated with **5-fold cross-validation**, so results are robust even on small datasets. Results are ranked and visualized in an interactive bar chart.

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Export chat history as PDF report
- [ ] LLM-suggested visualizations ("what chart should I use for this?")
- [ ] Support for Excel (.xlsx) uploads
- [ ] Feature importance explanations (SHAP)
- [ ] Deploy as Docker container
